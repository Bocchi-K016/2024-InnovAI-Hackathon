The city bursts with numerous entrepreneurs, sharing its culture and diversity with the rest of the World.\nEver since its foundation, it has been a major international trading seaport, thanks to the Atlantic coast. It also serves as a link between\nMorocco\n, Europe, and the rest of the world.\nThe bright and gleaming city of Essaouira provides a picturesque port and a wide breezy beach that offers a magnificent view. In the present day, the city blossoms, serving as a beautiful example of a unique well maintained mid-18th century secure seaport town.\nOrigin of the name Essaouira\nIn the Latin script, the name of the city is spelled as Essaouira, but in Arabic script, it is spelled as الصويرة. However, in Moroccan Arabic both spellings are used, thus s-Swirl. In the name, the noun Sur means wall.\nIn the Berber language, which is largely spoken in the city, the town is well known as Tassort, which means a small fortress. This name was used for a while before the official name, Essaouira, came to light.\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese knew it as Mogador, but all this changed in by the 1960s. Essaouira became the official name of the city.",

With beaches on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and the well-known Atlas Mountains, Morocco witnesses an influx of millions of visitors from Europe, Africa, and the rest of the world, every year. Morocco is one of the dream destinations for travelers for its culture, food, and warm people; amongst other reasons. One of the most incredible places in Morocco is the relatively unexplored\ncity of Meknes\n, an Imperial City.\nThe City of Meknes and Alaouite splendor\nMorocco has four Imperial Cities, namely\nFes\n,\nMarrakesh\n, Meknes, and\nRabat\n, of which Meknes is the quietest one. It is less than an hour’s drive away from Fes, its chaotic brother, and has always been the most reclusive of all the Imperial Cities of Morocco. In spite of being quieter, it is a vibrant city, composed of the old (medina) and the new (ville nouvelle). The medina and the ville nouvelle offer to a traveler a striking contrast just three miles apart, with the medina hosting historical wonders and the ville nouvelle boasting of modern splendor.\nIn the 17th century, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismaël decided to make Meknes one of the most beautiful and powerful Imperial cities in Morocco. And still, today, protected by around 40km of walls, it has preserved imposing monuments, including numerous mosques which earn it its nickname of the \"city of a hundred minarets\".\nThe city gets its name from the tribe ‘Meknessa’, which predominantly inhabited Eastern Morocco in the 8th century and was founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids and was treated as a military settlement; and later went on to become a capital under Sultan Moulay Ismail, who founded the great Alawite Dynasty. The way the entire city was built was influenced by the Spanish-Moorish style of architecture and has a fascinating blend of Islamic and European styles, which is evidenced through the high walls with grand doors. Its grandeur inspires the wonder of all those who visit the hill-top city today and is reflective of the architectural prowess of its creators.\nMeknes was declared a UNESCO World-Heritage Site in 1996 and its beauty has been carefully and delicately preserved. Even the building of the urban parts of the city sees a blend of Islamic and European architectural styles.",

The city bursts with numerous entrepreneurs, sharing its culture and diversity with the rest of the World.\nEver since its foundation, it has been a major international trading seaport, thanks to the Atlantic coast. It also serves as a link between\nMorocco\n, Europe, and the rest of the world.\nThe bright and gleaming city of Essaouira provides a picturesque port and a wide breezy beach that offers a magnificent view. In the present day, the city blossoms, serving as a beautiful example of a unique well maintained mid-18th century secure seaport town.\nOrigin of the name Essaouira\nIn the Latin script, the name of the city is spelled as Essaouira, but in Arabic script, it is spelled as الصويرة. However, in Moroccan Arabic both spellings are used, thus s-Swirl. In the name, the noun Sur means wall.\nIn the Berber language, which is largely spoken in the city, the town is well known as Tassort, which means a small fortress. This name was used for a while before the official name, Essaouira, came to light.\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese knew it as Mogador, but all this changed in by the 1960s. Essaouira became the official name of the city.",

With beaches on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and the well-known Atlas Mountains, Morocco witnesses an influx of millions of visitors from Europe, Africa, and the rest of the world, every year. Morocco is one of the dream destinations for travelers for its culture, food, and warm people; amongst other reasons. One of the most incredible places in Morocco is the relatively unexplored\ncity of Meknes\n, an Imperial City.\nThe City of Meknes and Alaouite splendor\nMorocco has four Imperial Cities, namely\nFes\n,\nMarrakesh\n, Meknes, and\nRabat\n, of which Meknes is the quietest one. It is less than an hour’s drive away from Fes, its chaotic brother, and has always been the most reclusive of all the Imperial Cities of Morocco. In spite of being quieter, it is a vibrant city, composed of the old (medina) and the new (ville nouvelle). The medina and the ville nouvelle offer to a traveler a striking contrast just three miles apart, with the medina hosting historical wonders and the ville nouvelle boasting of modern splendor.\nIn the 17th century, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Ismaël decided to make Meknes one of the most beautiful and powerful Imperial cities in Morocco. And still, today, protected by around 40km of walls, it has preserved imposing monuments, including numerous mosques which earn it its nickname of the \"city of a hundred minarets\".\nThe city gets its name from the tribe ‘Meknessa’, which predominantly inhabited Eastern Morocco in the 8th century and was founded in the 11th century by the Almoravids and was treated as a military settlement; and later went on to become a capital under Sultan Moulay Ismail, who founded the great Alawite Dynasty. The way the entire city was built was influenced by the Spanish-Moorish style of architecture and has a fascinating blend of Islamic and European styles, which is evidenced through the high walls with grand doors. Its grandeur inspires the wonder of all those who visit the hill-top city today and is reflective of the architectural prowess of its creators.\nMeknes was declared a UNESCO World-Heritage Site in 1996 and its beauty has been carefully and delicately preserved. Even the building of the urban parts of the city sees a blend of Islamic and European architectural styles.",
