![Alt text](https://github.com/Bocchi-K016/2024-InnovAI-Hackathon/raw/main/QuBit/logo.png)
## Problem Statement: 🤔
Imagine planning your first vacation to Morocco 🏖️. You're excited to explore its bustling markets, beautiful landscapes, and rich culture, but you’re overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information out there. Searching for recommendations online takes hours, but most sources are either too general or not in your preferred language 🌍💬.

Hiring a local guide sounds appealing, but it’s too expensive 💸, and you don’t know if it's really necessary for a smooth trip. You simply want a stress-free, affordable way to navigate Morocco’s top attractions, transport options, and hidden gems.

Is there a way to simplify travel planning and access accurate, real-time information without breaking the bank? 
Can we make it easier for travelers to get tailored recommendations without language barriers? 🌐
How can technology like GenAI improve the tourism experience in Morocco and make it more accessible to everyone? 

## Proposed Solution: 💡
Sahara Sage is the perfect solution for modern travelers looking for an easy, affordable, and personalized way to explore Morocco 🏞️. By offering real-time, multilingual recommendations, this AI-powered chatbot eliminates the need for costly guides 💸, while making crucial information easily accessible. Whether it’s finding top attractions, navigating transportation, or discovering hidden gems, Sahara Sage ensures tourists have a smooth, stress-free experience 🌍💬, helping them make the most of their trip without language barriers or hours of research.
